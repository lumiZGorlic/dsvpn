turns out dsvpn works if i use the following set up

1) dsvpn server on local PC, on port 1959, machine behind a router,
generated a ngrok URL using: 
sudo /snap/bin/ngrok tcp 1959
which gives sth like
tcp://4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19065 -> localhost:1959

2) dsvpn client on another PC connected to mobile data
to start dsvpn client do
sudo ./dsvpn client vpn.key [ngrok url] [ngrok port]
so that would be for example
sudo ./dsvpn client vpn.key 4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 19065



quiz - why not working if i do 'ngrok http 1959' ????
quiz - i run 'curl ipinfo.io/ip' and it shows same external ip on client and server. why ?
quiz - in scapy show that really everything goes out to server 
quiz - other ways to implement vpn (e.g. ssh)
